    incipit: The following is an ontology in Turtle format representing the Dimensional Fact Model, through which we describe the conceptual schema of a set of OLAP cubes.
    after_llm4bi: Below you can find (in the form of Turtle triples) the conceptual schema (following the Dimensional Fact Model)
      of a set of OLAP cubes, described through the above ontology. Please analyze it.
    after_cubes: |-
          Now I'm going to ask a question about metadata exploration on such cubes.
    after_question: |-
          For such a question, I expect you to provide the following output:
          The full answer you would give to the question. Keep it concise, avoid using particular formatting (e.g., emoji, headings, arrows, special characters), and keep it on a single line if possible. Let's call this <FULL_ANS>.
          A non-verbose, structured version of the answer, that strictly follows the following format instructions:
    after_format: |-
          Let's call this <STR_ANS>.
          A concise explanation of how you derived the answer, mentioning the key elements that led to it. Let's call this <MOT>.
          Ultimately, your answer should strictly follow this pattern using YAML syntax:
          Full: <FULL_ANS>
          Structured: <STR_ANS>
          Motivation: <MOT>
